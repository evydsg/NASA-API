Submitted by: Evelise Guenda

Time spent: 26 hours spent in total

## Summary

Nasa is an app that displays the picture of the day.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠üëåüèΩ

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [X] Created an additional screen


## API Choice
